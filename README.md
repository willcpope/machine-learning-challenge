# Machine Learning - Exoplanet Exploration

## Background

Over a period of nine years in deep space, the NASA Kepler space telescope has been out on a planet-hunting mission to discover hidden planets outside of our solar system.

To help process this data, I created machine learning models capable of classifying candidate exoplanets from the raw dataset.

## Steps

### Preprocessed the Data

* Preprocessed the dataset prior to fitting model.
* Performed feature selection and removed unnecessary features.
* Used `MinMaxScaler` to scale the numerical data.
* Separated the data into training and testing data.

### Tuned Model Parameters

* Used `GridSearch` to tune model parameters.
* Tuned and compared at least two different classifiers.

## Findings

* Create a README that reports a comparison of each model's performance as well as a summary about your findings and any assumptions you can make based on your model (is your model good enough to predict new exoplanets? Why or why not? What would make your model be better at predicting new exoplanets?).
